# WhatsApp AI Web - Network Access Guide

## 🌐 **Network Configuration Complete**

Your WhatsApp AI Web app is now configured to accept connections from:

- **Localhost**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Local Network**: `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`
- **Other Devices**: Any device on your network

## 🚀 **How to Access**

### **1. From Your Computer**

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### **2. From Other Devices on Your Network**

The app will automatically display your network IP addresses when it starts. Look for output like:

```
🌐 Network Access Information:
================================
📱 Access from other devices:
   http://192.168.1.100:3000
   http://10.0.0.50:3000
💻 Local access: http://localhost:3000
================================
```

### **3. Find Your IP Address Manually**

If you need to find your IP address manually:

**Windows:**

```cmd
ipconfig
```

Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter.

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
ifconfig
```

Look for "inet" addresses (not 127.0.0.1).

## 📱 **Accessing from Mobile Devices**

### **1. Connect to Same Network**

- Ensure your phone/tablet is on the same Wi-Fi network
- Open browser and go to `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`

### **2. Example URLs**

- `http://192.168.1.100:3000`
- `http://10.0.0.50:3000`
- `http://172.16.0.10:3000`

## 🔧 **Technical Configuration**

### **Server Binding**

- **Host**: `0.0.0.0` (accepts connections from any IP)
- **Port**: `3000` (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- **CORS**: Configured to allow all origins

### **Network Requirements**

- **Firewall**: Ensure port 3000 is not blocked
- **Router**: No special configuration needed for local network
- **Security**: Only accessible within your local network

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

### **Local Network Only**

- App is only accessible within your local network
- No external internet access required
- WhatsApp Web authentication still required

### **Firewall Settings**

If you can't access from other devices:

**Windows Firewall:**

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Add Node.js or allow port 3000

**Mac Firewall:**

1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall
2. Allow Node.js through firewall

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Can't Access from Other Devices**
    - Check if devices are on same network
    - Verify firewall settings
    - Try different IP address from the list

2. **Connection Refused**
    - Ensure app is running
    - Check if port 3000 is available
    - Try restarting the application

3. **WhatsApp QR Code Not Showing**
    - This is normal - QR code only shows on first connection
    - Use the same device that initially authenticated

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check Network**: Ensure all devices on same Wi-Fi
2. **Test Local**: Try `http://localhost:3000` first
3. **Test Network**: Try `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000` from same computer
4. **Test Mobile**: Try from phone/tablet on same network
